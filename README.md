# Service Purpose
This service is responsible for generating messages to be sent out via the SFD comms proxy.
It is invoked by input messages on it's input SQS queue, which subscribes to multiple SNS topics to listen to various
criteria that could be triggers for generating outbound comms requests.

# Service features
- Listens to an SQS queue for messages containing details of events that should trigger comms to be sent out
  - Status change messages for claims can trigger outbound request for new claim email, or in the future request for evidence
  - Reminder request messages can trigger outbound request for reminder emails to be sent out
  - Application created emails can be triggered by messages from the application service when a new application is created
- Saves an audit to the database of the request
- Forwards request on to the FCP SFD Comms component via an output SNS topic

## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v22` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v11`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd ahwr-message-generator-backend
nvm use
```

## Local development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

OR to run dockerised locally:

```bash
./scripts/start
```

### Testing

To test the application run:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json).
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

### Formatting

#### Windows prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## Development helpers

### MongoDB Locks

If you require a write lock for Mongo you can acquire it via `server.locker` or `request.locker`:

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  const lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  try {
    // do stuff
  } finally {
    await lock.free()
  }
}
```

Keep it small and atomic.

You may use **using** for the lock resource management.
Note test coverage reports do not like that syntax.

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  await using lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  // do stuff

  // lock automatically released
}
```

Helper methods are also available in `/src/helpers/mongo-lock.js`.

### Proxy

We are using forward-proxy which is set up by default. To make use of this: `import { fetch } from 'undici'` then
because of the `setGlobalDispatcher(new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl))` calls will use the ProxyAgent Dispatcher

If you are not using Wreck, Axios or Undici or a similar http that uses `Request`. Then you may have to provide the
proxy dispatcher:

To add the dispatcher to your own client:

```javascript
import { ProxyAgent } from 'undici'

return await fetch(url, {
  dispatcher: new ProxyAgent({
    uri: proxyUrl,
    keepAliveTimeout: 10,
    keepAliveMaxTimeout: 10
  })
})
```

## Docker

### Development image

Build:

```bash
docker build --target development --no-cache --tag ahwr-message-generator-backend:development .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -e PORT=3001 -p 3001:3001 ahwr-message-generator-backend:development
```

### Production image

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag ahwr-message-generator-backend .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -e PORT=3001 -p 3001:3001 ahwr-message-generator-backend
```

### Docker Compose

A local environment with:

- Localstack for AWS services (S3, SQS)
- MongoDB
- This service.
- A stub version of the application backend.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`

### SonarCloud

Sonarcloud is configured for this repository, and will be triggered by pull requests.
You can view the SonarCloud dashboard for this repository at: https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=DEFRA_ahwr-message-generator-backend
